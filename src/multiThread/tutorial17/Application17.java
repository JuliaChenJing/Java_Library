	 * In this Java Video Tutorial I cover how to use Java threads.
	 * 
	 * A thread is just a block of code that is expected to execute while other
	 * blocks of code execute. That’s it. When you want to execute more than one
	 * block of code at a time you have to alert Java.
	 * 
	 * In this video I show you how to alert the interpreter. Part 1 of this
	 * series is here Java Video Tutorial. Heavily commented code follows the
	 * video.
